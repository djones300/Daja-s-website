            <article> 
               <p>Hello, and I'm Daja and welcome to my website! I was born in Topeka Kansas, and have lived in</p>
                <p>Denton Texas since I was about seven. I have two younger siblings (a sister and brother),  and I have two</p>
                <p>dogs, one is a pitbull named Cesar and the other is a shih tzu names Chloe. I am currently a Senior Computer</p>
                <p>Science major at Texas Woman's University.</p>

            <h2>What I'd like to do in the future</h2>
            <article>
               <p>There are so many different things that you can do with a CS degree, but I would like to go into data.</p>
               <p>I am choosing data because I know there is still so much work to be done in this field, and there are </p>
               <p>many opportunities within the field. I also hope to travel while working. </p>
